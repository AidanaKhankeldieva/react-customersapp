                        He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the internet, maybe in an attempt to
                        relate to genius. However, it is simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, but
                        math was one area where he excelled, unsurprisingly.
                        Einstein encouraged the development of the nuclear bomb. His involvement is often
                        misinterpreted, with some claiming that he helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did
                        was write a letter to President FDR encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which led to
                        the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman,
                        Einstein was convinced that America needed the atomic bomb before the Nazis.
                        He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn’t work out, Einstein could have become
                        a violinist. His mother played piano so he had the love of music instilled in him—via violin
                        lessons—at the young age of five.
                        He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel’s first president, Chaim Weizmann, died,
                        Einstein was offered the position, but he declined.
                        He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he married his
                        cousin, Elsa Lowenthal. He was, actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later
                        years. He had affairs he never tried to hide, he moved the entire family to Berlin without
                        discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.
                        He won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. This alone isn’t particularly surprising. What is
                        surprising is the fact that he didn’t receive it for the general or special theory of
                        relativity, but rather for the photoelectric effect.
                        He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But by his own admission,
                        he never made a particularly good sailor. In fact, he didn’t even know how to swim.
                        He really didn’t like socks, and usually didn’t wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, he
                        bragged about getting away “without wearing socks” while at Oxford.
                        He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn’t known until the 1980s, but according to
                        correspondence between Albert and Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902
                        called Lieserl. At one point, all mention of her in letters stopped so her fate is unknown.
                        His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain
                        without permission. He eventually got the permission necessary from Einstein’s son, but he was
                        fired from Princeton when he refused to turn the brain over. He kept it for over forty years
                        before finally returning it in 1998.

                    <li>A heading to signal something important or declare a new section/paragraph.
                    <li>A couple paragraphs describing the amazing things you want to share. Remember to use emphasis on
                        key
                        words!</li>
                    <li>A list of key things to know about something in your paragraph. Why not do an ordered list and
                        unordered
                        list?</li>
                    <li>An image of something relevant and visually appealing. You can store your image as an asset in

                        project folder or link back to the source on the web. The link should be clickable, but the
                        image
                        doesn't need to be.</li>
                    <li>A footer at the bottom of the page declaring your copyright on such a wonderful write-up, and

                        you use the copyright symbol!</li>
