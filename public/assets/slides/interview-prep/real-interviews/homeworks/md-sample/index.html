Thanks so much for participating in our interview process. We know that exercises like these take time and effort away from other important things in your life, and we truly appreciate it. We also tried our best to make this task as close as possible to one of the main tasks you’d work on as a Slack employee.

**The Scenario:** The exercise consists of reviewing a pull request that adds certain functionality to our "emoji-picker" app.

In this scenario, you are working with a team of developers on the emoji-picker app. One of your teammates, who is new to working with React and Javascript, asks you to review a pull request. This pull request adds some new functionality to the app.

Your task is to review and provide as much detailed feedback as possible in order to make the new changes production-ready.

**Logistics:** Navigate to the 'Pull Requests' tab on this page and you’ll find the pull request to review. This pull request is unique to you so use it to add all of your code review comments. You’ll also find more information (e.g. steps to run the app) on the pull request description.

Note that the exercise assumes some familiarity with React. 

**Submission:** You have 2 days to complete the exercise. If you need additional time or any special accommodation please let us know. Once you are done working on the exercise, just send us an email and indicate that you have completed it.

This exercise is very important in assessing your technical fit, so make sure you're happy with the result and that it reflects your skills. Your submission should be something you would be proud to submit on the job.

Your changes will be graded based on your ability to point out issues in the code, suggest best practices, validate that the UI looks and behaves as expected, communicate with your teammates and recommend better alternatives.  We also assess the clarity of the comments on your code review.

We’ve implemented discretionary measures to ensure that no personal information is associated with these exercises—this enables graders to make unbiased decisions. Please do not include your name anywhere in the solution.

If you have questions, please reach out by email.
