                    Let's see the main features of Reselect library,

                        - Selectors can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state.
                        - Selectors are efficient. A selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes.
                        - Selectors are composable. They can be used as input to other selectors.
