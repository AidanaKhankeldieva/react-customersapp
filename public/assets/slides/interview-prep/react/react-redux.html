                    Flux is an application design paradigm used as a replacement for the more traditional MVC pattern. 
                    It is not a framework or a library but a new kind of architecture that complements React and the concept of Unidirectional Data Flow. 
                    Facebook uses this pattern internally when working with React.

                    Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps based on the Flux design pattern. 
                    Redux can be used together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (about 2kB) and has no dependencies.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    Redux follows three fundamental principles:

                        1. Single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single store. The single state tree makes it easier to keep track of changes over time and debug or inspect the application.
                        2. State is read-only: The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened. This ensures that neither the views nor the network callbacks will ever write directly to the state.
                        3. Changes are made with pure functions: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write reducers. Reducers are just pure functions that take the previous state and an action as parameters, and return the next state.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    Instead of saying downsides we can say that there are few compromises of using Redux over Flux. 
                    Those are as follows:

                        1. You will need to learn to avoid mutations: Flux is un-opinionated about mutating data, but Redux doesn't like mutations and many packages complementary to Redux assume you never mutate the state. You can enforce this with dev-only packages like redux-immutable-state-invariant, Immutable.js, or instructing your team to write non-mutating code.
                        2. You're going to have to carefully pick your packages: While Flux explicitly doesn't try to solve problems such as undo/redo, persistence, or forms, Redux has extension points such as middleware and store enhancers, and it has spawned a rich ecosystem.
                        3. There is no nice Flow integration yet: Flux currently lets you do very impressive static type checks which Redux doesn't support yet.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    mapStateToProps() is a utility which helps your component get updated state 
                    (which is updated by some other components):

                        const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
                            return {
                                todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)
                            }
                        }

                    mapDispatchToProps() is a utility which will help your component to fire an 
                    action event (dispatching action which may cause change of application state):
                    
                        const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
                            return {
                                onTodoClick: (id) => {
                                dispatch(toggleTodo(id))
                                }
                            }
                        }

                    Recommend always using the “object shorthand” form for the mapDispatchToProps
                    
                    Redux wrap it in another function that looks like (…args) => dispatch(onTodoClick(…args)), 
                    and pass that wrapper function as a prop to your component.
                    
                        const mapDispatchToProps = ({
                            onTodoClick

                    Dispatching an action within a reducer is an anti-pattern. 
                    Your reducer should be without side effects, simply digesting the action payload and returning a new state object. 
                    Adding listeners and dispatching actions within the reducer can lead to chained actions and other side effects.

                <h5> 9) Are there any similarities between Redux and RxJS? <span class="float-right badge badge-pill badge-primary">redux</span></h5>
                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    These libraries are very different for very different purposes, but there are some vague similarities.

                    Redux is a tool for managing state throughout the application. 
                    It is usually used as an architecture for UIs. 
                    Think of it as an alternative to (half of) Angular. 
                    RxJS is a reactive programming library. 
                    It is usually used as a tool to accomplish asynchronous tasks in JavaScript. 
                    Think of it as an alternative to Promises. 
                    Redux uses the Reactive paradigm because the Store is reactive. 
                    The Store observes actions from a distance, and changes itself. 
                    RxJS also uses the Reactive paradigm, but instead of being an architecture, it gives you basic building blocks, 
                    Observables, to accomplish this pattern.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    You need to follow two steps to use your store in your container:

                        1. Use mapStateToProps(): It maps the state variables from your store to the props that you specify.
                        
                        2. Connect the above props to your container: 
                            The object returned by the mapStateToProps function is connected to the container. 
                            You can import connect() from react-redux.
                        
                            import React from 'react'

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    You need to write a root reducer in your application which delegate handling the action to the reducer generated by combineReducers().

                    For example, let us take rootReducer() to return the initial state after USER_LOGOUT action. 
                    As we know, reducers are supposed to return the initial state when they are called with undefined as the first argument, no matter the action.
                    
                        const appReducer = combineReducers({
                        /* your app's top-level reducers */
                        })
                        
                        const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
                        if (action.type === 'USER_LOGOUT') {
                            state = undefined
                        }
                        
                        return appReducer(state, action)
                        }

                    In case of using redux-persist, you may also need to clean your storage. 
                    redux-persist keeps a copy of your state in a storage engine. 
                    First, you need to import the appropriate storage engine and then, 
                    to parse the state before setting it to undefined and clean each storage state key.
                    
                        const appReducer = combineReducers({
                        /* your app's top-level reducers */
                        })
                        
                        const rootReducer = (state, action) => {
                        if (action.type === 'USER_LOGOUT') {
                            Object.keys(state).forEach(key => {
                            storage.removeItem(`persist:${key}`)
                            })
                        
                            state = undefined
                        }
                        
                        return appReducer(state, action)

                    The @ symbol is in fact a JavaScript expression used to signify decorators.

                            import { connect } from 'react-redux'

                            function mapStateToProps(state) {

                            }

                            export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(MyApp)

                        With decorator:

                            import * as actionCreators from './actionCreators'

                            import { connect } from 'react-redux'

                            function mapStateToProps(state) {
                            return { todos: state.todos }
                            }

                            function mapDispatchToProps(dispatch) {
                            return { actions: bindActionCreators(actionCreators, dispatch) }
                            }

                            @connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)
                            export default class MyApp extends React.Component {
                            // ...define your main app here
                            }

                        The above examples are almost similar except the usage of decorator. 
                        The decorator syntax isn't built into any JavaScript runtimes yet, and is still experimental and subject to change. 
                        You can use babel for the decorators support.

                    Reducers always return the accumulation of the state (based on all previous and current actions). 
                    Therefore, they act as a reducer of state. Each time a Redux reducer is called, the state and action are passed as parameters. 
                    This state is then reduced (or accumulated) based on the action, and then the next state is returned. 
                    You could reduce a collection of actions and an initial state (of the store) on which to perform these actions to get the resulting final state.

                <h5> 18) What is the proper way to access Redux store? <span class="float-right badge badge-pill badge-primary">redux</span></h5>
                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    The best way to access your store in a component is to use the connect() function, that creates a new component that wraps around your existing one. This pattern is called Higher-Order Components, and is generally the preferred way of extending a component's functionality in React. This allows you to map state and action creators to your component, and have them passed in automatically as your store updates.

                    Let's take an example of <FilterLink> component using connect:
                    
                        import { connect } from 'react-redux'
                        import { setVisibilityFilter } from '../actions'
                        import Link from '../components/Link'
                        
                        const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => ({
                        active: ownProps.filter === state.visibilityFilter
                        })
                        
                        const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => ({
                        onClick: () => dispatch(setVisibilityFilter(ownProps.filter))
                        })
                        
                        const FilterLink = connect(
                        mapStateToProps,
                        mapDispatchToProps
                        )(Link)
                        
                        export default FilterLink

                    Due to it having quite a few performance optimizations and generally being less 
                    likely to cause bugs, the Redux developers almost always recommend using connect() over accessing the store directly (using context API).
                    
                        class MyComponent {
                            someMethod() {
                                doSomethingWith(this.context.store)
                            }

                    Containers subscribe to Redux state updates and dispatch actions, and they usually don't render DOM elements; they delegate rendering to presentational child components.

                <pre class="pre"><code class="language-javascript">
                    Constants allows you to easily find all usages of that specific functionality across the project when you use an IDE. 
                    It also prevents you from introducing silly bugs caused by typos – in which case, you will get a ReferenceError immediately.

                    Normally we will save them in a single file (constants.js or actionTypes.js).
                    
                        export const ADD_TODO = 'ADD_TODO'
                        export const DELETE_TODO = 'DELETE_TODO'
                        export const EDIT_TODO = 'EDIT_TODO'
                        export const COMPLETE_TODO = 'COMPLETE_TODO'

                        export const CLEAR_COMPLETED = 'CLEAR_COMPLETED'

                    In Redux, you use them in two places:
                    
                        1. During action creation:
                        
                            Let's take actions.js:
                            
                            import { ADD_TODO } from './actionTypes';
                            
                            export function addTodo(text) {
                                return { type: ADD_TODO, text }
                                }

                        2. In reducers:
                        
                        Let's create reducer.js:
                        
                        import { ADD_TODO } from './actionTypes'
                        
                        export default (state = [], action) => {
                            switch (action.type) {
                                case ADD_TODO:
                                return [

                    If the ownProps parameter is specified, 
                    React Redux will pass the props that were passed to the component into your connect functions. 
                    So, if you use a connected component:

                        import ConnectedComponent from './containers/ConnectedComponent';
                        
                        &lt;ConnectedComponent user={'john'} />

                    The ownProps inside your mapStateToProps() and mapDispatchToProps() functions will be an object:
                    
                        { user: 'john' }

                    You can use this object to decide what to return from those functions.

                        Both call() and put() are effect creator functions. call() function is used to create 
                        effect description, which instructs middleware to call the promise. put() function creates 
                        an effect, which instructs middleware to dispatch an action to the store.

                        Let's take example of how these effects work for fetching particular user data.
                        
                            function* fetchUserSaga(action) {
                                // `call` function accepts rest arguments, which will be passed to `api.fetchUser` function.
                                // Instructing middleware to call promise, it resolved value will be assigned to `userData` variable
                                const userData = yield call(api.fetchUser, action.userId)
                                
                                // Instructing middleware to dispatch corresponding action.
                                yield put({
                                    type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS',
                                    userData
                                })

                        Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. 
                        The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met. 
                        The inner function receives the store methods dispatch() and getState() as parameters.

                        Both Redux Thunk and Redux Saga take care of dealing with side effects. 
                        In most of the scenarios, Thunk uses Promises to deal with them, whereas Saga uses Generators. 
                        Thunk is simple to use and Promises are familiar to many developers, 
                        Sagas/Generators are more powerful but you will need to learn them. 
                        But both middleware can coexist, so you can start with Thunks and introduce 
                        Sagas when/if you need them.

                            2. Lets you go back in time by cancelling actions.
                            3. If you change the reducer code, each staged action will be re-evaluated.
                            4. If the reducers throw, you will see during which action this happened, and what the error was.
                            5. With persistState() store enhancer, you can persist debug sessions across page reloads.

                        Selectors are functions that take Redux state as an argument and return some 
                        data to pass to the component.

                        For example, to get user details from the state:
                        
                            const getUserData = state => state.user.data

                        These selectors have two main benefits,
                        
                         - The selector can compute derived data, allowing Redux to store the minimal possible state
                         - The selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments changes

                        Relay is similar to Redux in that they both use a single store. 
                        The main difference is that relay only manages state originated from the server, 
                        and all access to the state is used via GraphQL queries (for reading data) and mutations 
                        (for changing data). Relay caches the data for you and optimizes data fetching for you, 
                        by fetching only changed data and nothing more.
