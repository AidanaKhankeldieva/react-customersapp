            <li>Go to your home directory.</li>
            <li>List all the files in your current directory.</li>
            <li>Now, create a new folder called ‘temp’.</li>
            <li>Rename this folder to ‘files’.</li>
            <li>Go to the ‘files’ folder.</li>
            <li>
              Run a command to get the current date and time and save the output
              to a file called 'now. NOTE: to get date simply type 'date' on
              terminal
            </li>
            <li>Copy ‘now’ to a file called 'before'</li>
            <li>
              List all the files in this directory. Use a more detailed listing
              where you can see the files' permissions, date written, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a file called 'temp' without using a text editor. (There
              are at least three easy ways to do this.)
            </li>
            <li>Rename 'temp' to 'test'</li>
            <li>Go up one directory.</li>
            <li>
              Delete the ‘files’ folder with a single command. (The command you
              use should also delete all of the files inside of the folder.)
