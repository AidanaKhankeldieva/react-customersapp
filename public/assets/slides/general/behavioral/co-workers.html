          The interviewer is looking for your self-awareness, knowledge of your strengths, areas of development, with a particular focus on others’ perception of you.

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          This is a moment to sing your glory using someone else’s voice. A good practice is to quote official performance reviews from your co-workers and seniors. Please make sure to use concrete examples about your contributions to the team, the impact, and the team appreciation. You can tailor your answer to what is critical for the job you are applying to increase your chance of success.

            <li>Focus too much on yourself. The interviewers who ask this question care more about how well you work with others. Please talk and exhibit your collaboration skills, and how you put the team’s interest ahead of your interest.</li>
