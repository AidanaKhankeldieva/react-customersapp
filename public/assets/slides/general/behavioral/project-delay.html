      <p>
        No matter if you are in engineering, sales, or marketing, communication plays a critical role for you to be effective at work. Thus, the interviewers will try their best to get a read on your articulation and communication style.

        <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          Most projects in the industry are delayed. Thus, this is a true real-life challenge that each one of us will face. Here are a few things that the interviewers might be looking for, in your answer:
          <ul>
            <li>How much real project experience do you have?</li>
              <li>How effectively have you managed the delay?</li>
              <li>How did you handle the stress?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="img" ><img src="./images/delay.jpeg"></div>
        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          Pick up a real life experience. It is perfectly fine to acknowledge that you were part of the reason for the initial delay. It often happens that we uncover new challenges as the project proceeds. What is important is that you are able to discover the delay in a timely manner, maintain cool and calm, analyze the situation, get extra hands, reduce scope, better-streamline dependencies, or motivate your entire team to work extra hours, to turn the project around.

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          <ul>
            <li>Claim you are always on time, never experienced a project delay. Seriously? All interviewers know it is not true. Even if you are truthful, it probably shows you do not have much real life project experience.</li>
              <li>Blame the delay on your teammates. It might be the case, but it is never a good practice to blame on your teammates. It is very convenient for you to use them as a good excuse. It is also very convenient for the interviewers to vote you down.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>

          <ul>
            <li>How do you make sure your projects are on time?</li>
              <li>How do you recognize that your projects are not on the right trajectory?</li>
