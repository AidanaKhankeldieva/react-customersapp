        <strong>Question:</strong> Tell me about a time you had to adjust to a colleague's style in order to complete a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> Everybody is different. A method may work for some, but may not work for others at all. The most successful individuals know how to tailor their style based on the other person’s/team’s style and preference. The interviewer is looking for flexibility to form healthy work relationship and get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> Use STAR framework, go deep on your effort to understand this person’s style, seek advice from others on how to best work with this person, and tailor your message to an approach that is more acceptable to her. Please explain how you were able to figure out ways to partner with her or motivate her to get the project down.
      </p>
