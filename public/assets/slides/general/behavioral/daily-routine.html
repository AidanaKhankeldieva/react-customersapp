        <div class="box-item">
           The interviewer is trying to assess the kind of work environment you are familiar with. Is it fast pace or slow pace? If it is a fast pace, how do you manage your priorities and time? From your answer, the interviewer can probably get a good sense on how aggressive you are with your work schedule.


        </div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
           Do not simply enumerate the laundry list that you do everyday. That is not what the interviewer is asking for. Instead, focus on how much time you spend on technical work, how much on meetings. Do not forget the time you spend to think and find creative new ways to solve problems. This is also a good opportunity to demonstrate how you keep up with whatâ€™s new in the industry and commit to learn new things. For example, attending meetups, reading blogs, etc.

        <p>In terms of priorities, you may want to cover short-term priorities and medium-term priorities. What tools do you use to keep your day organized? Purely on calendar? Or something else. For medium-term, do you use something like OKRs to keep your priorities structured? Anyway, explain clearly the tools you are using.</p>

          <p>When balancing different priorities, please note timeline is not the only factor that drives priority. In the technology world, quality is definitely another key dimension to consider and cover. To launch the right product, in some companies, it is perfectly fine to delay. Make it clear that you manage priorities considering all factors, not just the deadline.</p>
        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          <ul>
            <li>Get into too much detail about your daily routine detail. Focus on key things, such as how much time do you spend on writing code each day, how much time in meetings.</li>
            <li>Be too rigid about your priority. The reality is that in most cases, you prioritize based on what is needed by your work and your family.</li>
            <li>Do not cover the time you spend to catch up with the industry and learn new things. It is important for you to show you are a lifetime learner.</li>
