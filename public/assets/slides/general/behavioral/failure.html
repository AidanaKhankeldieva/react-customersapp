      <strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> The interviewer is evaluating
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your journey of handling obstacles</li>
      <li>Critical thinking ability to analyze when you failed</li>
      <li>Your ability to learn from failure or setbacks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> Choose a failure where you can tell a story. It needs to be very
      specific. Define what the failure meant to you. Describe the situation, and explain why it was a challenge. Then
      mention the actions you took and the outcome. Finally, sum it up with the learnings from the failure that make you
      a stronger individual.

        <strong>Answer that you havenâ€™t failed or chosen an insignificant failure:</strong> Come on, let us face it. We
        are all human beings. Each of us must have experienced some failure, catastrophic or not. A failure that had a
        significant impact on you due to your actions is a good example. An insignificant example will only lead the
        interviewer to think you are not genuine or do not have considerable life experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Lack of specifics.</strong> The interviewers may conclude that you have made it up. Please see the the
        STAR framework.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Too much detail:</strong> Try not setting up the ground for too long and come to the gist. Too much
        detail will give the impression that you are not concise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Missed what you have learned:</strong> You get overly excited or emotional about your experience and
        forget to sum up what you have learned and how this experience helped your personal development.
      </li>
