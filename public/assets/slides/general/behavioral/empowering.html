        <strong>Question:</strong> How do you balance empowering your reports and demanding strong results?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> While micromanaging is the most commonly referenced example of poor management, over-delegating under the name of empowering is another common mistake made by managers, especially junior ones. Delegating without expecting strong results will often lead to weak performance. Strong leaders empower their reports, but also demand strong results and have framework to drive strong results. In this question, the interviewer is looking for
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Your natural preference towards results</li>
        <li>Your management philosophy about empowering</li>
        <li>Management practice to drive strong results</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> First, share your management philosophy. How do you empower people? Refer to data or quote from your employees. Emphasize on how you push the team to deliver strong results. Again, refer to some data, especially quote from your manager or peers on your teamâ€™s performance will be very helpful.</p>
