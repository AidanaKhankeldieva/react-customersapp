      <p>
        <strong>Questions:</strong> Tell me about a leadership experience that you are most proud of.      
      </p>
       
        <p><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong>Obviously, the expectation of leadership varies drastically based on your experience level. For a junior member, the interviewers will likely look for :</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Demonstrate and drive accountability,</li>
          <li>Take initiatives, and</li>
          <li>Foster collaboration among team members.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a more senior candidate, the interviewers will likely look for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Establish vision,</li>
          <li>Get buy-in across the organization,</li>
          <li>Orchestrate the execution of a large-scale initiative, and</li>
          <li>Drive changes</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> It is impossible for you to cover every dimension of leadership. Please select a story that can primarily highlight one aspect of leadership that you want the interviewer to take away. Your primary goal is for the interviewer to remember the initiatives you had undertaken, the magnitude of the accomplishment, and the most significant leadership dimension you had demonstrated. To make sure your message genuinely stands out, you can provide a brief at the end of the story.</p>
        <p>You may want to tell different stories depending who is asking the question since a hiring manager or a teammate may appreciate different things. It is perfectly fine for you to use the same story, but may want to emphasize different elements based on what you know about the interviewer.</p>
        <p>Please make sure to be specific about the details of the project and what you did for it to be successful. There are many factors that contribute to the success of an initiative. You want to make the interviewer believe your leadership has played a critical role in the success.</p>

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loopholes</strong> in your story. If things do not add up together, you will lose credibility and there is no way for you to get a high evaluation from the interviewer.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of specific detail.</strong> Some stories may have happened many years ago and you no longer remember all the details. Please make sure look it up to get critical details including the numbers./li>
          <li><strong>Try to cover everything.</strong> If you try to cover everything, the interviewer can easily read your intention and question the truthfulness.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>
        <ul>
          <li>Tell me a successful project that you were part of</li>
          <li>Tell me an experience that you have driven a change successfully</li>
        </ul>
