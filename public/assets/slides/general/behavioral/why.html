        <div class="box-item">
           The interviewer is trying to understand what drives you, how your values align with the companyâ€™s, what are the chances to accept the offer if offered, and what is the chance you will do well in this company.
        </div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
           Choose an answer where your goals align with the position and also show the value-add to the company. It should be tailored according to the specific job position. Show how your actions and your plans are in harmony. Your knowledge, enthusiasm, and efforts will go a long way in answering this question. A good way to answer this question is to illustrate how well this job aligns with your career goals.

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          <ul>
            <li>Having a generic answer for all interviews. You need to go deeper, show what you have learned about the company, why you like it and why you will be a good fit.</li>
            <li>Emphasize too much on work-life balance and risk. There is nothing wrong about joining a more stable company due to personal and family needs, but it should be a secondary reason, not the primary reasons, at least in the interview :) In your answer, you should focus on your primary reasons: impact, learning, career growth.</li>
