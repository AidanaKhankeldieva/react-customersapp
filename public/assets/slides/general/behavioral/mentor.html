        <strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> Life is full of give and take. When you mentor others, you are not only helping others, but also learn from them and improve yourself. How much you are willing to give has big impact on how far you can go with your career. For this question, the interviewer is looking for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your willingness to help people</li>
        <li>How effective you are as a mentor or advisor</li>
      </ul>
        <div class="img" ><img src="./images/mentor.png"></div>
       <br>
      <p>
        <strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> After you give a positive answer to the question, pick up one or two stories on what you did. Please make sure to cover enough detail. Are these people in your company or outside? Did you help them on the technical dimension or other aspects? What are the top advices you think worked really well for your mentees? What have you learned in this process? These are all great points to make.

        <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
       <ul>
         <li>
          <strong>Simply answer “No”:</strong> In reality, you must have helped somebody, even if in your college. It does not have to be an official mentor-mentee relationship. Pick someone that you have provided meaningful help and improved her chance of success.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>Lack of specifics.</strong> The interviewers may conclude that you have not really done it if you do not include specific examples.
         </li>
         <li>
          <strong>Too much detail:</strong> The interviewer just wants to make sure. Too much detail will give him/her impression that you are not concise.
