           <ul>
            <li>Proactively reach out to the other party to fully understand their perspective.
            </li>
            <li>Did you try to fully understand the other party’s story?</li>
            <li>Steer both parties to find solutions that are optimized for the company and the combined team.
            </li>
            <li>If needed, escalate to the right authorities in a timely manner.
            </li>
            <li>After the conflict was resolved, reach out to further strengthen the relationship with the other party.
            </li>
