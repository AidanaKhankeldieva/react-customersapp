        <h2 class="display-5">What Have You Learned Recently?</h4>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      <strong>Detail Question:</strong> What is the last thing you learned about xxx from a book, magazine or website?
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> The interviewer is assessing your zest to remain updated in
      the ever-changing world.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> Have the list of your favorite books and your key takeaway from these
      books, your websites, apps, blogs or podcast and why you like them. Sure, you should answer what you have learned,
      but more importantly, go the extra mile to comment on related books or podcasts to show that you are active at
      learning and getting informed.
    </p>

    <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>Unable to articulate one thing that you have learned recently. It is always a good practice to pay extra
        attention to the news while you are heading to interviews since some news topic may come up in the interview.
      </li>
      <li>Unable to even name a few books, blogs, or podcasts. This only shows you are closed and probably not well
        informed by the new development in the industry.</li>
      <li>Mentioning something that is very mundane or you are expected to know.</li>
    </ul>


    <div class="box"><strong>Question variations:</strong></div>
    <ul>
      <li>How do you stay current with your knowledge?</li>
      <li>What is the most innovative thing youâ€™ve read this year?</li>
      <li>Who is your favorite author? What is your favorite book?</li>
      <li>Give an example where you learned something really quick.</li>
    </ul>
