        <div class="box-item">
          We have all experienced situations where people share different opinions and are stuck in stalemate since nobody can convince anyone. In such situations, it is often the case that proceeding with any option is better than being stuck. Strong leaders seek to make compromises in such cases so that the team can proceed. It is a critical skill to make the right compromises in any type of organizations. When asking this question, the interviewers are trying to assess your flexibility and your creativity to make the right compromises to resolve conflicts.

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          Without saying, you need to use the STAR method to describe the situation, what you did and the result. Simply making a compromise is never a strong leadership. You need to showcase why making a compromise was the right thing to do in this circumstance, what you did to break the stalemate and how you subsequently resolved the conflict. Make sure you lay the foundation, why different people have different views and how everyone believes theirs is correct. Explain what you did to make sure everyone understood the situation, the compromises that the team had to make and articulate the actions that made a difference.

          <ul>
            <li>You did not go through a thorough analysis or compromised and ended up in a situation that is not necessarily right for the organization.</li>
            <li>You made compromises because you had to, such as pressure from your manager. This is the chance to show your action has made a difference and was not to please someone.</li>
