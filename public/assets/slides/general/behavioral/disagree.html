        <div class="box-item">
           The interviewer is looking for your involvement in the decision-making and post-decision process. In particular, how well did you function as a leader to make your voice heard before the decision? And how well did you demonstrate followership to support a decision that you disagree?

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          It is a good practice to share your philosophy about decisions. A good practice is to be actively involved in the decision discussion so that your voice is heard and assist the decision maker to make the right decision with all the relevant data and different perspectives available before the decision making. Once a decision is made, follow and support the decision even if you do not agree. To illustrate active participation during decision process, you should share your perspective and why you prefer this route, how does it compare with the ultimate decision. You should also share how the final decision played out. If it played out well, please share what you have learned from this. If it did not work out, did the team come back to retry with your approach? If it did, what could you have done differently to better influence the team before the decision was made?
