        <strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong> The interviewer is evaluating
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your response to the unexpected</li>
        <li>Your learning from the unexpected to become stronger</li>

      <p>
        <strong>Best practice to answer:</strong> Use the STAR framework and
        describe the Situation and the Task. The action you took to resolve it
        and it’s outcome. Focus on how you responded the unexpected with
        positive energy, list the research you have done to understand the
        challenge and the approaches you have identified to solve the problem,
        the challenges you have faced along the way and the final outcome. Do
        not forget to mention what you have learned in the journey and how the
        experience positively impacted your career.

      <div class="box"><strong>Common pitfalls:</strong></div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Lack of specifics. It is critical to have enough detail to make people
          believe in your story. Without enough detail, the interviewers may
          conclude that you have made it up.
        </li>
        <li>
          The unexpected thing in your story should have been expected with
          people at your experience level. If this is the case, in the
          interviewer’s mind, she will start to form negative view about you.
