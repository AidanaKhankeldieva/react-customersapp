      </div>
      <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> Tell me about a time when you had to convince another staff member or leader, whom you had no direct authority over, to buy into a new idea or project? How did you accomplish this?
      </p>
      
       
        <div class="box"><strong>What is the interviewer looking for:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
           Ability to influence without authority is a key skill at work. No matter whether you are a junior or a senior member, there are times you need to get others to support your plan. The other party could be in your team, in the cross-functional team on the same project, in another project team, or even outside your company. To effectively influence others, one has to communicate well and build trust with others. From your answer, the interviewers can easily tell whether you had experience influencing others. They will be assessing your answer with the following questions in mind:
           <ul>
             <li>
              How difficult was the situation,</li>
              <li>How do you identify the right stakeholders to influence,</li>
              <li>How sophisticated were your tactics,</li>
              <li>How effective was your approach,</li>
              <li>How well you listened to others’ concern, and</li>
              <li>How creative you are to address others’ concern
             </li>
           </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="img" ><img src="./images/influencer.png"></div>

        <div class="box"><strong>Best practice to answer:</strong></div>
        <div class="box-item">
          First of all, before the persuasion, demonstrate that you have a comprehensive picture of the topic you are trying to influence. Otherwise, you will lose your credibility with the stakeholders. This requires you to identify the right stakeholders and reach out to them, listen to them, capture relevant context, especially key stakeholders’ point of view. Secondly, identify the options and the tradeoff between different options, be open to discuss the options and choose the one that works the best for the organization.

<p>In the interview, explain clearly what you have done to identify the options, adjust your proposal based on input from the stakeholders, and drive everyone to agreement and commitment after the decision. Clearly demonstrate it is your stewardship that led to the success of the project.</p>

        <div class="box-item">
          <ul>
              <li>Trivial examples. Your example is too trivial, then the interviewer will think you do not have more complicated experience of influencing others.</li>
              <li>Lack of detail on why it was challenging and the actions you have taken to win over others’ support
            </li>

              <li>Describe a situation that you successfully convinced someone to support your idea</li>

              <li>Describe a case that you successfully assembled a team to support your initiative.
