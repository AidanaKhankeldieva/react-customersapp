# It was 2 rounds interview: live video
    1 Coding: building shopping cart(React);
    2 Techincal interview (system design, restAPI etc);
        and below are question from Technical interview:

* Requirements
1) Layout
2) Style
3) Add card functionality with window.prompt
4) Move cards to other columns

4 How can you make sure your Binary Search Tree stays balanced as you add items?

5 Do you know any Data structures that do balancing automatically?

6 How would you find case smallest element in Binary Search Tree? What is the run time on that?

### System design

It scrapes car websites like craigslist and cars.com and downloads the informations on used cars.
Scraper attends you with list of key value pairs like: make, model, price, location, color, mileage.
And co-worker gives you 10gb file of car data(json) no duplicates and tells you here is your job to build us web app and which lets user to search over this data. 
    Your options of course  structed queries like: what are the red habits of a car that has less than 50K mileage for sale in LA and return all the cars that match this.

`Web Scraper` (how would you build the Front End and the Back End )

And the rest listen guys, because many technical subjects are involved such as how is you API going to look like and etc..
