### Two Types of Paths
> - **Absolute :** An absolute path is defined as the specifying the location of a file or directory from the root directory(/).
> - Ex: D:\documents\something.doc
> - **Relative :** Relative path is defined as path related to the present working directory(pwd).
> - Ex: ./something.doc
> - When using relative paths you take as reference the current working directory while with absolute paths you refer to a certain, well known directory. Relative paths are useful when you make some program that has to use resources from certain folders that can be opened using the working directory as a starting point.
